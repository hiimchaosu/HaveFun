# <h1>HaveFun<h1/>
Bot used for fun purposes on my discord server.<br/>
Since March, the bot has gone through a huge overhaul, before which ffmpeg was used for YouTube music streaming.<br/>
Wavelink(0.9.10) + Lavalink is needed to use the music function from now on.<br/>
Works on discord.py v1.7.3!<br/>
Bot needs an additional folder 'data' with Your 'token.0' inside! Get Your token from [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
